# Description: Makes a robot move in a shape that looks like a box.
 
# Create a Robot object that is attached to 
# GPIO pins 17, 18, 22, and 27 of the 
# Raspberry Pi. These pins are inputs for the
# L293D motor controller.
# Objects have data and behavior that is 
# predefined by the Robot class (i.e. blueprint) 
# declared inside the GPIO Zero library.
# Change the order of the numbers inside
# the parentheses until you get the desired behavior.
